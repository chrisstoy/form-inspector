# Form Inspector
Chrome extension for investigating Angular Forms

This is a Work in Progress! Load it into Chrome Extensions as an unpacked extension to try it out.

Adds a new Sidebar to the Debug tools.  Select an element then open the `Form Inspector` sidebar panel. If the element has an Angular Component with a FormGroup, the Form information will be displayed in the panel.

Select different elements to display different Forms.

Currently only supports a single Form per Component.
